# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy covers consensus, networking, mempool, wallet/node behavior, and API security issues in this repository.

## Supported Versions

During alpha, only the latest published tag/release is considered supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability:

1. Do not publish exploit details immediately.
2. Open a security report issue with minimal reproduction details.
3. Include affected commit/tag, impact, and deterministic steps.

If private reporting is introduced in future releases, this file will be updated with a direct contact channel.

## Disclosure

- Critical issues: coordinated disclosure after a fix or mitigation is available.
- Non-critical issues: public issue discussion is acceptable.

## Out of Scope

- Requests for market support, listing support, or non-technical promotion.
- General node configuration questions that are not vulnerabilities.
